// When running PHP in a shared host environment, what is the major security concern when it comes to session data?

1) Sessions on shared hosts are easily hijacked by outside malicious users
2) All of the above
3) You cannot use a custom data store in shared hosts
4) Session data stored in the file system can be read by other scripts on the same shared host				http://php.net/manual/en/book.session.php
5) Users outside the shared host can access any site which created a session for them
